# Data Visualization of Pokemon Data with Python and Seaborn (side project)
# Abstract
Have you always wanted to make visuals of pokemon data? I found a csv file that has stats on most of the pokemon and I used python, seaborn and matplotlib to make some cool visualizations. This work was sampled from a cool tutorial on seaborn's great visualizations(https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial#step-1).  This covers a good summary of Seaborn’s strengths. In practice, the “well-defined set of hard things” includes: Using default themes that are aesthetically pleasing, making attractive statistical plots, visualizing information from matrices and data frames. I have included the work in a jupyter notebook file and the csv file that has the pokemon data used for this side project.

This preview is a colorful Violin Plot of Pokemon types.

This preview is a heatmap of Pokemon attack styles.

You can try this code from this project in the repository.

# Findings
From this project I used default themes that are aesthetically pleasing. Then I set a custom color palette and making attractive plots. I was foud this to easy and flexible in displaying distributions. Creating visualized information from matrices and DataFrames.

# Challenges
The challenge was creating visualizations that made it easy to understand the strengths of the different types of pokemons. In the code of this project, it will displays all the visualizations used. The fact it was easy to create visualizations, there was a surplus of options that made it diffcult to select one visualizations over another.

# Conclusion
This project gave me a great understanding on how important visualizations play a role in making decision based on data. I have mentioned in another project, Seaborn is a great package and it make visualization creation easy for anyone.
