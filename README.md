# Data-Visualization-of-Pokemon-Data-with-Python-and-Seaborn-side-project-
Have you always wanted to make visuals of pokemon data? I found a csv file that has stats on most of the pokemon and I used python, seaborn and matplotlib to make some cool visualizations. This work was sampled from a cool tutorial on seaborn's great visualizations(https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial#step-1).  This covers a good summary of Seaborn’s strengths. In practice, the “well-defined set of hard things” includes: Using default themes that are aesthetically pleasing, making attractive statistical plots, visualizing information from matrices and data frames. I have included the work in a jupyter notebook file and the csv file that has the pokemon data used for this side project.
