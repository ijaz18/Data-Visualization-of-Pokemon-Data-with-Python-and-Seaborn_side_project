# Data-Visualization-of-Pokemon-Data-with-Python-and-Seaborn(side project)
Have you always wanted to make visuals of pokemon data? I found a csv file that has stats on most of the pokemon and I used python, seaborn and matplotlib to make some cool visualizations. This work was sampled from a cool tutorial on seaborn's great visualizations(https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial#step-1).  This covers a good summary of Seaborn’s strengths. In practice, the “well-defined set of hard things” includes: Using default themes that are aesthetically pleasing, making attractive statistical plots, visualizing information from matrices and data frames. I have included the work in a jupyter notebook file and the csv file that has the pokemon data used for this side project.

Taken from Elite Data Science:

In practice, the “well-defined set of hard things” includes:

Using default themes that are aesthetically pleasing.
Setting custom color palettes.
Making attractive statistical plots.
Easily and flexibly displaying distributions.
Visualizing information from matrices and DataFrames.

Those last three points are why Seaborn is our tool of choice for Exploratory Analysis. It makes it very easy to “get to know” your data quickly and efficiently.
